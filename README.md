#Scientific Article Search Engine (arXiv)
This project implements a comprehensive Information Retrieval (IR) system in Python. It applies the Vector Space Model to a corpus of scientific articles (Physics, Computer Science, Mathematics).
Key Features:
Manual implementation of an Inverted Index.
TF-IDF weighting and Cosine Similarity scoring.
Formal evaluation (Precision@k, Recall, MAP) based on arXiv categories.
Optimization via Relevance Feedback (Rocchio Algorithm).
Ablation study on text preprocessing steps (Stopwords, Stemming).
